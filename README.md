# Choose Your Own Adventure  

## Underwater In The Salish Sea

[PLAY GAME HERE](https://ccmatson-choose-your-own-adventure.netlify.app/)

When I made this game, I imaged that my client was an aquarium in the Pacific Northwest. In Washington State, many people and animals rely on our natural resources including the Salish Sea. This game is intended to be used as engagement piece that could be played to get someone excited to learn more about life underwater.
